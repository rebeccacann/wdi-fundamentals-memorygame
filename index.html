<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkeisuijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down in rows on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards and, once all of the cards have been played, the player with the most matching cards wins. The great thing about this memory card game is that it is a very good game for young children, and can be mentally stimulating for adults as well! To make the game more challenging use the rule that the pairs must not only match in rank, but must also match in color. For example a six of hearts and a six of spades would no longer count as a match, but a six of spades and a six of clubs would.</p>
